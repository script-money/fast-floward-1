# ‚è© Fast Floward
Welcome to Fast Floward! We are excited to have you here. This repository is where you will find all content, resources, and links for the Fast Floward bootcamp.


* **Before you do anything, please make sure you are in the [Decentology Discord](http://discord.gg/Decentology)**. This is where all things Fast Floward will be happening. If you are participating in the bootcamp, you should have been assigned the "Fast Floward" role within Discord. This will make your name bright green. If you have not been assigned this role, please DM Chase Chapman#8019.

# üìö Where to Find Content

* **Content will be shared every day at 10am Pacific Time.** All content will be shared in this repository. We will send a message in the #‚è©-fast-floward Discord channel every day at 10am Pacific Time once content is posted.

* **Content will be paired with Quests to help you put your knowledge to the test.** You can think of these like homework ‚Äî but way more fun and a lot more creative.

* **We will hold Office Hours** several times throughout the week to help you work through the quests.

* **You can expect about 1.5 to 2 hours worth of videos each week** (note that Week 1 will likely be a bit more) and about 2 to 2.5 hours to spend on the quests throughout the week (this is a minimum, but since they are creative in nature, you can certainly spend more time if you‚Äôd like).

* **We highly encourage you to complete all quests.** If you do, we have a special surprise for you at the end of the bootcamp! :wink:
